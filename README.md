🌟 About Me

Hi, I’m Anvitha — a data science enthusiast with a strong background in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries. I've successfully delivered 20+ data analytics projects for leading pharma companies, focusing on extracting actionable insights and supporting business decisions.

I built my technical foundation during my Master Data Science Program (Guvi), gaining hands‑on experience with Python, Power BI, Machine Learning, and MySQL. During my engineering studies, I learned SAS, and in my previous role, I leveraged Excel extensively to transform complex data into meaningful insights.

I’m passionate about applying analytics and automation to solve real‑world business challenges. An avid researcher, I’ve also published work in green synthesis and bioactive functional beverages.
